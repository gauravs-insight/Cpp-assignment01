These are the two of the programs, 1. Number Guessing Game 2. Simple Calculator
These programs are solely based on C++ as it is the part of C++ assignment.
Number Guessing Game : We have basically used two of the libraries for random number generation and other one for seed randomness (time). We have max the attempts upto 7, you can change that according to your preference, you can make it infinite or change the attempts to make it easy, medium or hard i.e. the number of attempts define it's level.
Simple Calculator : Here we haven't done much work, we simply have define fumctions and called it. As the name suggests, we have only four basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
We can further change the codes as per our need as I have already explained for Number Guessing Game. Thank You!!
